starting: plant a k-clique in a G(n,1/2)
2 problems: detection- is this a random G(n,1/2) or planted?
recovery - get the clique

impossible when k<2log2(n)
easy when k>sqrt(n)
spectral analysis on adj matrix?
in the middle we dont have a poly time algo.


for new problems: can we find where these bounds between impossible/hard/easy are?

low-degree polynomial method to predict/explain average cast time.

studing a restricted class: multivariate polynomial f: R^n -> R^m
input: maybe a graph, Y \in {0,1}^n choose 2

in this case the output might be {0,1} (true or false)

low means O(logn) or so where N is the input dimension

examples are power iterations, locals on sparse graphs, block matrix analysis, ...

it's like a fourier transform, but for statistical analysis tools. the idea is that we can approximate most statistical tools as low-complexity analysis polynomials?
