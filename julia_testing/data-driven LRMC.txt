example: 
rank <= r nonconvex optimization

signal processing
normally we use Hankel structured low rank completion
from past data as an image of

try and solve via directly taking the SVD of the Hankel matrix
where we take n samples (since we're assuming the matrix has complexity n)
and solve for the rest of the Hankel from there.

w \in B -> w is trajectory of B
B is an exact model for w

basically he just wants to directly solve the system with no redundancy
i really hope that the empirical part ends up looking good but even if it does that's probably still suspicious

this is like doing LRMC with exactly r columns; youre basically getting rid of the redundancy you need to account for measurement errors?
