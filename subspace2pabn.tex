consider a U where the rows have minimum angle $\theta$

then we can leverage that into a minimum probability of w falling into a given sign pattern: it's a circular? proportion of the surface of the r-ball
this allows us to get an easy probabilistic lower bound of satisfying the PABN first condition (the columns one), which will potentially require very low r.

we could potentially leverage this into a lower bound on the second condition by performing a combinatorial analysis of the mask matrix, but I think that this result is too weak for that.

it's more likely that we'll have to make more advanced prob. arguments by finding some way to convert the distribution of u's columns into the distribution of probabilities of sign patterns.
