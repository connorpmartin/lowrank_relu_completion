Learning Linear Dynamical Systems with Hankel Nuclear Norm Regularization

Hankel matrices: skew diagonals are constant

classical: large least squares problems

recently: regularization via Hankel matrices

"n-dimensional exponential / sum-of-exponentials"
via regularization on the rank of the Hankel matrix

sample complexity: presumably the sample size? so like the second dimension of the observed data

we've got a markov system:
x(t+1) = Ax(t) + b
y(t) = cx + d

y is a single observed value dependent on the underlying data x

h = A^{t-1}b


basically x(t) = Ax(t-1) + b ... 
so we have a bunch of summed terms x(t) = h_1 + h_2 + ... + h_n + A^tx(0)
we can think of this as a set of changes h_1, ...., h_n

so the order of the system?? is the rank of the matrix 
rank(H(h_1,...,h_{2n-1}))

here we can basically guess the h_i by introducing a sum matrix U and 

recovery can be gauged via l2 error on the h_i,

or by the spectral distance between the hankel matrices of the h_i
(it's really important to see a gap because it basically means that we're correctly defining the complexity of the system)

they found some cool statistical results 
spectal distance leq sqrt(n/snr*T)
where R is the order, T is the number of observed things
n is the total number of impulses we need to predict?

basically nuclear norm regularization creates sufficiently simple models


understand spectral gap,
